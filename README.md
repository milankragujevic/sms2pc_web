SMS2PC Web
===========

Requires PHP 7 and that's about it. 

## Installation
Copy the files into a folder or the web root, and `chmod 0777 -R store` folder. 

Open receiver.php and change the API key (currently gJBXV6vBOd) to something unique to your application, and also change that in the mobile app so the two components can communicate successfully. 

## Mobile App
Find the mobile app for Android [here](https://github.com/milankragujevic/sms2pc_android).
